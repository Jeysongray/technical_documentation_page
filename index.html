            <p>Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web
                applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side development)
                and
                back-end development (also called server-side development).</p>

            <p>This tutirial assumes you have zero experience coding. However, to follow the steps provided here with ease, you
                need
                basic knowledge of how the World Wide Web works and computer usage. This means you should be familiar with
                keyboard
                shortcuts such as: </p>
            <code class="codespan">Ctrl+s Ctrl+z Ctrl+v, etc.</code>
            <p>Should you encounter any difficulties, apply your technical sophistication by simply 'Googling' the problem.</p>

            <p>Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content,
                design
                and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
            </p>
            <i>After this lesson, you should be able to write sipmple HTML and CSS code like creating a HTML document and
                styling
                it: </i>
        
            <code class="codespan">h1 {<br>background-color: red;<br>color: blue;
            <br>}<br><br><b>This changes the text color of the h1 element to blue and gives it a background color of red.</b>
                   </code>

            <code class="codespan">h1 {<br>font-weight: bold;<br>}<br><br><b>This makes the font bold.</b>
           </code>

            <p>HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in order to turn it into a
                web
                page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS,
                short
                for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the
                cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that’s widely used to add functionality
                and
                interactivity to web pages. In HTML and CSS, the code for creating and styling document are known as tags or
                elements and selectors respectively. Some examples below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tables</li>
                <li>Forms</li>
                <li>Buttons</li>
                <li>CSS grid</li>
                <li>Paragraphs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Choosing a text editor also known as Integrated Development Environment is pretty easy and there's a whole lot to
                choose from: Sublime, Bracket, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Notepad, Notepad++ and many more.</p>
            <p>As a beginner, I would reccommend something simple like Notepad if you're using a windows OS or Notepad++. After
                a
                while, you may try some of the others and may come to find a preference. I especially like VS code as I have
                worked
                on all the IDEs mentioned above and just enjoy the VScode interface. But choosing an IDE should be the least of
                your
                worries at this point.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Writing your first HTML code is anything but complicated. In &lt;HTML5&gt;, which is the latest HTML version, you
                begin by declaring a
                &lt;!Doctype&gt; like so:</p>
            <code class="codespan">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>&lt;meta name="viewport"content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>...content of your web page goes here.
           <br>&lt;/body&gt;<br></code>

          <p>The above code is the standard declaration. You don't need to memorize this as a good number of text editors
                declares
                this for you. For instance, in VScode, type: </p>
            <code><kbd>Ctrl + ! + return</kbd> and the entire doctype code above would be automatically displayed! Like I said, easy right?</code>
